Hello! Great site, gets me any info i need everytime.
to the point, i was looking up the differences (resistance wise) between a metal wardrobe, and a locker.
and well, as anyways i can see the stats on the side, i decided to read the Overview, and realized it has some wrong information in it.
"The Locker has the most storage slots of all storages, and is the most durable storage."
If you're experienced in the game, it becomes clear that the wardrobe has more storage slots than the locker,
and if the stats put in the "Metal wardrobe" section are correct, then there is no difference in durability,
they both have the same health and explosion resistance.

I would appreciate if you could change the information, as it might become harmful to new players to the game.
Thanks.
